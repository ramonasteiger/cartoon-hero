	<h2>About Moto Moto</h2>
	<p>Moto Moto is a character of Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa and a minor character in its video game adaption. He is a large, handsome and muscular hippopotamus with a very deep and suave voice who enjoys flirting with the lady hippos by the use of words or by flexing his chest muscles. He isn't extremely bright, but he is a ladies' man and he is described as being "aggressive but friendly," and is the way the standard male hippo should look. He falls in love with Gloria and she is delighted. But later as they have their date in a lake, he confesses that the only reason he really loves her is for her body. Gloria accepts this until Melman shows up and tells him everything that Gloria likes and hates.</p>
